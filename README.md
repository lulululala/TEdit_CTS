## Contribution
### 1. Multi-Resolution Noise Estimator
We propose a multi-resolution architecture for the diffusion noise estimator considering that different attributes can influence the time series on varying scales.

<p>
Our model divides the original time series into serval patch sequences with different resolutions. Then we concatenate the input patch embedding sequences of different resolutions into a single vector and parallelly send them into the processing module with other information, e.g., attributes and diffusion step. We use the attention masking mechanism to ensure that attention is only performed in the same resolution.

### 2. Bootstrap Learning Algorithm
To overcome the lack of source and target time series pairs in real-world dataset. We propose a training algorithm called bootstrap. Specifically, it self-scores the time series generated by the model itself, and chooses the top K samples with the highest score. Then we use these samples to further update the diffusion model.

### 3. Experimental Results
We compare our method Time series Editing (TEdit) with the baselines on a synthetic dataset Synthetic and two real-world datasets Air and Motor. As shown in the table below, our method significantly improves the performance of overall and edited attributes, while able to preserve the performance of preserved attributes.
